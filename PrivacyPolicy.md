2 Factor Authenticator uses account name and secret key for the sole purpose of generating and displaying second factor code. This information is **not** transmitted by the app anywhere. However, the app relies on built-in Windows services to roam your data across devices. The roaming feature is bound by Microsoft's service agreement and their privacy policy.  
The developer of this **app claims no reponsibility** towards securing your data either on the device or in the Microsoft cloud(if you use the roaming feature).
