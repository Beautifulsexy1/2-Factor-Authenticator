# 2 Factor Authenticator Privacy Policy  
## How does 2 Factor Authenticator use your information?  
2 Factor Authenticator uses account name and secret key for the sole purpose of generating and displaying second factor code. This information is **not** transmitted by the app anywhere.

## Camera Access
2 Factor Authenticator requires optional camera access to scan QR codes and auto populate account information on the add account screen. The app does not store or transmit images captured using camera during the QR code scanning process.
You can disable camera access either on first run or anytime later from Windows Settings.

## Account Sync
2 Factor Authenticator relies on built-in Windows services to roam your data across devices. You can disable this in app settings.
The roaming feature is bound by Microsoft's service agreement and their privacy policy. The developer of this **app claims no reponsibility** towards securing your data either on the device or in the Microsoft cloud(if you use the roaming feature).
